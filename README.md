# Human-Activity-Recognition
The experiments was done on volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.

There are more than 10000 rows in the data, where each row represents one of the six activities. The activities are listed as 1 through 6 in y column and labeled in the Activity column in the dataset. There are 560+ predictor columns derived from the sensors measuring various metrics or characteristics of a certain activity. The main objective is to catch the hidden signal in the feature space (predictors) through machine learning classification algorithms mapping predictors to the activity column. Make sure to reduce dimensions, as 560 are too many, and then try various classification algorithms on the reduced dimensions.
